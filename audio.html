    						<i>Escape From Paradise</i> -- the long-awaited novel about 
    						the 1979 Iranian Revolution -- is heartfelt, 
    						powerful, and compulsively readable. The lives of a 
    						group of Iranians and a young American woman with 
    						her two children are seriously threatened in the 
    						devastating aftermath of the bloody Iran revolution 
    						of 1979. Combined, their lives make a tapestry that 
    						reflects the entire colorful canvas of society's 
    						different political persuasions and social classes. 
    						For reasons of their own, each is blacklisted and 
    						cannot leave the country through the normal means. 
    						Unbeknownst to each other, they individually employ 
    						the services of an underground smuggling ring, run 
    						by a profiteer of the revolution, to guide them 
    						across the Iran-Turkish border. Each person has a 
    						different fascinating story, a distinct and 
    						astonishing reason for embarking upon such a 
    						dangerous journey, a journey that encompasses their 
    						past -- bygone days that led them to the shocking 
    						reality of the present. It is during these 
    						flashbacks that their unforgettable stories 
    						masterfully unfold and the process of reevaluating 
    						their pasts are lyrically narrated. Told with 
    						compassion, this is the story of a group of people 
    						who, under the most adverse of circumstances, are 
    						forced to resort to their common humanity in order 
    						to discover the truth that they hope will ultimately 
    						set them free. This novel presents the reader with 
    						an unparalleled opportunity to experience not only 
    						the self-defeating, heartbreaking political 
    						struggles of Iranians during the last century but 
    						also their resiliency. More importantly, it captures 
    						the soul of Iran -- its enchanting culture and 
    						wonderful, colorful and hospitable citizens. Majid 
    						Amini is a skillful storyteller, a writer who 
    						portrays the anguished truth of the human heart and 
    						the triumph of the human spirit during the brutality 
    						of the bloody revolution in the richly lyrical prose
    						and unforgettable narratives.
