							heroic and daring deeds in which he always plays a

							stories and the romantic figure the servant 
							portrays, he worships and idolizes the man only to 
							later find out he has been deceived. Upon this 
							realization, a 'war' breaks out between the two and 
							is maintained throughout the remainder of their 
							relationship. It is a touching tale of love and 
							betrayal, full of daring exploits, childhood pranks 
							and the sweet and bitter pain of growing up.
